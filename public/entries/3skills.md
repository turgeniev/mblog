## 1. How to stop taking things personally

Everything we experience in our lives involves us somehow.

As a result, we tend to have an inherent bias towards assuming
that pretty much everything that happens to us is actually about us.

## 2. How to be persuaded and change your mind

For most of us, most of the time, our beliefs are not simply ideas that we hold to be true,
but they make up key components of our identity.

Your ability to succeed and learn over the long-term is directly proportional
to your ability to change what you believe in response to your ignorance and mistakes.

## 3. How to act without knowing the result

Throughout most of our lives, almost everything has a clear result attached to it.

In real life there’s no way of knowing — for certain — if what you’re doing is “right” or not.

We avoid moving and acting without knowing. And because we cannot act on what we don’t know,
our lives become incredibly repetitive and safe.

For one, no one else can decide what’s right for your life but you.
The fact that you looking for it in a book or something is itself part of the problem —
you are looking to know the result before acting.

> Dark Knight (the movie)

The fact is: sometimes you just have to do things for no other reason than to do them.

And while this will result in a thousand tiny failures,
it will also likely result in your life’s biggest successes.

Stop making everything you do about accomplishing some fucking goal.
